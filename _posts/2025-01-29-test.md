  This blog is a record of all things linguistics that I find interesting. I hope to publish posts talking about different topics ranging from how the IPA chart works to the different ways languages are interconnected and interesting features that languages possess.

This image below is a full sized image of the IPA chart, a key tool for understanding how the sounds in a word work. The next post will cover how to read the IPA and why you should care.
