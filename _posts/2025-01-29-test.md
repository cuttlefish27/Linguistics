  This blog is a record of all things linguistics that I find interesting. Ideally I hope to publish one post every week talking about different topics ranging from how the IPA chart works to the different ways languages are interconnected and cool features that languages possess.

## The IPA
This image below is a full sized image of the IPA chart, a key tool for understanding how the sounds in a word work. The next post will cover how to read the IPA and why you should care.
